nodeRubiks (WIP)
============================================================================
This is a Work In Progress.
One day i hope this will be a simple Node.js Rubik's Cube cooperative game.

<h4>Commands:</h4>
Mouse BT1 + MouseMove -> Rotates the Cube.</br>
Arrow Keys -> Rotates the Cube on a constant movement.</br>
'R' key -> Reset the rotation of the Cube (At the momment it only works for the movement generated from "Arrow Keys").</br>
