nodeRubiks (WIP)
============================================================================
This is a Work In Progress and this port was made thanks to the great tutorials found at http://learningwebgl.com/ .
One day i hope this will be a simple Node.js Rubik's Cube cooperative game.

To start the game run the "server.js" through node.js and go to localhost:8002.

No multiplayer functionalities are implemented yet.

<h4>Commands:</h4>

Desktop:
Arrow Keys -> Rotates the Cube.
Keys from "Q" to "O" and from "A" to "L" -> Game Moves.

Mobile:
Touch -> Rotates de Cube.
Game moves not yet implemented on mobile. :(

All:
"New Game" -> Starts a new game
"Save State" -> Save the current state of the cube.
"Load State" -> Load the current saved state of the cube.
